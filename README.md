The goal of this repository is to stress test the Real Time Collaboration (RTC) feature of JupyterLab and Jupyter Server and is a needed requirement [to avoid users having issues when they enable RTC](./docs/why.md).

## Real life

The tests aims to replicate real life cases, meaning that most of them are running in a distrbuted way.

You can run the tests on a standalone (local laptop or CI) machine, in which case the distributed behavior is simulated. You can also run the tests in a real a distributed environment like Kubernetes, this however requires you to setup additional infrastructure and configuration. Please note you can also run the Kubernetes flavored tests on a local Minikube instance.

## Discoveries

We maintain [a list of discovered issues](./docs/issues.md) as well a [potential solutions](./docs/solutions.md).

## JupyterLab

The RTC stress test are being discussed [in an issue in the official JupyterLab repository.](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/14532)
<!--
## Install

[Install](./docs/install.md) the tool directly from PyPI and [launch it](./docs/use.md) from the command line.
-->
## Develop

Setup your [environment](./docs/environment.md) to run the [tests](./docs/tests.md).

You can also use the [user interfaces](./docs/ui.md) if you prefer.
