# Jupyter RTC Test

> üì∂ Stress tests for ü™ê Jupyter üîå Real Time Collaboration (RTC).

The goal of this repository is to stress test the Real Time Collaboration (RTC) feature of JupyterLab and Jupyter Server and is a needed requirement [to avoid users having issues when they enable RTC](./docs/why.md).

You can run the stress tests from the CLI (Command Line Interface) or from a UI (User Interface).

## Distributed Actors

The tests aims to replicate real life cases, meaning that most of them are running in a distrbuted way.

You can run the tests on a standalone (local laptop or CI) machine, in which case the distributed behavior is simulated. You can also run the tests in a real a distributed environment like Kubernetes, this however requires you to setup additional infrastructure and configuration. Please note you can also run the Kubernetes flavored tests on a local Minikube instance.
